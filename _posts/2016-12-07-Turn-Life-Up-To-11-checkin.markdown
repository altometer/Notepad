For the past 9 days, I've been in an extreme (for me) workout regimen. Upping my calories to 3500, and working out nearly every day of the week.

# No pain no gain.
Ow. Ow ow ow. So much sore in every nook and cranny of my fiberous being. And I have to do it again to myself tonight. The first thing to keep in mind, is that there is good and bad pain from working out. To get bigger muscles, you are literally damaging them to make them repair themselves and come back stronger. No, I don't expect to grow yellow spikey hair at some point in my training.

I can also say there has been quite a time sacrifice going to the gym so often. This has definitely put strain on other aspects of my life. I have not been able to enjoy nearly as many hobbies as I would like. Considering my other primary at the moment is quadcopters and I lost the custom one I built to the wind...guess it's gym only for right now.

# Why would you do this to yourself?

I am pushing myself so hard in order to establish a baseline routine. At the end of my gym's 21 day program, I will absolutely scale back to 30-45 minutes 3 times a week. I am not morbidly obese, or actively fighting heart disease. I however, have discovered that I also can not do 10 pushups, or hold 40 lbs over my head for more than a few minutes.  I want to be the best me I can possibly be. Becoming significantly healthier physically will push many aspects of my life in the right direction.


I can say, honestly, I feel great. Better than I have in years. The closest I have come to how I feel now, is when I used to bike 3 miles to work every day. The aches and pains are more of a numb blur at the moment. I am extremely attentive, no Caffiene involved at the moment. Getting 7-8 hours a sleep every night, I burst out of bed like a morning person and maintain my attention throughout the entire day. I could get used to this level of energy, motivation, and excitement to accomplish the day.

# What about picky eating?

What has been the hardest is simply eating enough. I definitely had to resort to protein shakes to maintain macro-nutrient ratios. I am having nowhere near the issue with eating new, cleaner food as I thought I would. Simply, if you get hungry enough, you really will eat almost anything. I can't stomach seafood still, but I have been trying more and more foreign sauces or flavors. I have been using [My Fitness pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to carefully track and monitor every ounce of food that I have consumed. I will admit to breaking food dedication and getting Chic-fil-a a few times. I've regretted it every time. Between the salt and the grease, it just doesn't sit well with me by the time my exercise rolls around.
