It's that time of year again. The leaves are changing colors, acorns and walnuts threatening me with their barrage, and the subtle cool breeze encroaches.

I made an oath of sorts to myself last year. That my 25th year would be the last where I don't take full responsibility for my health entirely. The biggest change, is likely to be diet.

For many years, I went on eating very oddly. It's a pattern that is more and more commonly recognized these days. I love chicken nuggets, french fries, deepfried almost anything, and most junkfood. I'd eat burgers and chicken as long as they don't have much more flavoring than salt, pepper, and garlic.  I would eat plain white rice only, and corn, only off the cob.

To sum it up, I ate only 4-5 different meals. At all. This went on for around 16 years before I discovered that I could use the money from my newfound job at burgerking to buy lots of junkfood. Eating fast food from multiple places gave me the illusion of diversifying my pallet. But, the problem is almost all of their recopies are the same. Salt, MSG, pepper, deep fry. The holy Chic-fil-a is of course, a mild exception of this rule, but nevertheless still a large source of fatty, oily foods.

The core meals:
1. White Rice + garlic and butter w/ corn on the side.
2. Spaghetti with plain tomato sauce only.
3. Peanutbutter crackers or sandwiches.
4. Vegetarian vegetable soup.
