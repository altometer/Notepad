It's that time of year again. The leaves are changing colors, acorns and walnuts threatening me with their barrage, and the subtle cool breeze encroaches. All these things for me, mark one more year of having made it through life.

I made an oath of sorts to myself last year. That my 25th year would be the last where I don't take full responsibility for my health entirely. The biggest change, is likely to be diet.

## My less than normal eating habits.

For many years, I went on eating very oddly. It's a pattern that is more and more commonly recognized these days. I love chicken nuggets, French fries, deep fried almost anything, and most junk-food. I'd eat burgers and chicken as long as they don't have much more flavoring than salt, pepper, and garlic.  I would eat plain white rice only, and corn, only off the cob.

To sum it up, I ate only 4-5 different meals. At all. This went on for around 16 years before I discovered that I could use the money from my newfound job at burger king to buy lots more junkfood. Eating fast food from multiple places gave me the illusion of diversifying my pallet. But, the problem is almost all of their recopies are the same. Salt, MSG, pepper, deep fry. The holy Chic-fil-a is of course, a mild exception of this rule, but nevertheless still a large source of fatty, oily foods.

The core meals:
1. White Rice + garlic and butter w/ corn on the side.
2. Spaghetti with plain tomato sauce only.
3. Peanutbutter crackers or sandwiches.
4. Vegetarian vegetable soup.
5. Poptarts

That was it. Seriously. Many people describe what I used to do simply as being a picky eater. However, it aligns almost perfectly what is modernly accepted to be [Selective Eating Disorder](http://www.montecatinieatingdisorder.com/anorexia/articles/neophobia-extremely-picky-eating/). Years ago I used to meet every symptom of that weird kid in the corner and more. Food can't touch, proffering it to be on entirely separate plates. Foods can't have any sauces, spices, rubs, or dips excluding ketchup. I felt it was a major victory the first time I actually branched out and ate spaghetti with marinara sauce.

Today, I am still nowhere near normal, but have spread my wings far enough to not be remotely concerned or anxious about eating in public. My eating definitely creates friction between my foodie wife and I. There are also food supplements such as the aptly named human-kibble [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com/). This is a super-goop designed to be edible/drinkable for every meal of the day. The types of people that buy this are typically software engineers and individuals I could easily find myself associated with.

## Exercise.
In effort to reduce weight, build stamina, and build muscle in that order, I'll be starting a relatively extensive excercise program.

To start off, I'll be doing the strength exercises outlined in [the Simple Sience Fitness page](http://ss.fitness/#beginner-programs). I'll be using a local gym three times a week, Monday, Wed, and Friday on the way in to work. Every other day, I will be doing cardio. With a cold winter ahead, I am working on rigging up my bike with training rollers and breaking out my old DDR pad. Setting up a Linux gaming arcade cabinet to play [Stepmania](http://www.stepmania.com/) will be a later post.

## Hobbies and projects.
To break an old habit, I'll be heavily focusing on only committing to one or two projects at a time. I am a serial project-starter severely lacking in the finishing category. To name a few current ones:

1. Finish Insulating the porch with foam board.
2. Work on my wife's car to get it past inspection.
3. Set up the above-mentioned gaming Rig for fitness + health.
4. Finish setting up the new Nas, automated PC backups, and site backups.
5. Racing FPV quadcopter! (lots more to come on this one.)
6. The 20 hour method for adopting new skills blog post/video.

This doesn't even scratch the surface, but I'll be posting when possible.
