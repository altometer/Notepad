Now that my car is finished *for now.* I have an endless list of other projects to work through. Nearly all of the joists in our basement have been ravaged by termites in the past 150 years the house has been standing. In that time, there have been innumerable pipes and wires strewn about. I have to make sense of it all, and stop the house from caving in.

![Here's the layout of the basement.]()
Here's the layout of the basement. It's a stone foundation with finished concrete flooring. There's a stove in the corner here. I'd like to use the chimney for that, if it's in tact, as the new backbone of all my wiring. If possible, I'd like to run all of the electric through here to drastically cut down on the number of holes I have to make upstairs.

##Planned Tasks:
* Sister new 2x8's to all of the joists.
* Jack up the floors to get them as close to plum as possible.
* install new posts to provide additional support for the longer spanning joists.
* re-point the stonework.
* Finish the concrete pour in the second half of the basement.
* Rip out un-needed wires.
* Replace the basement lights so they all work with one switch at the top of the stairs.
* replace stairs with spiral staircase.

**Lots to do.**
